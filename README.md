##   1.	Draw a flowchart and write an algorithm to find the sum of first 100 natural numbers.
##   2.	Draw a flowchart and write an algorithm to find the largest of three numbers x, y and z.
##   3.	Draw flowchart  and write an algorithm for the problem of determining prime number?
##   4.	Draw a flowchart  and write an algorithm which generates first 50 items of the Fibonacci  series:  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
##   5.	Design an algorithm to convert a decimal number, n, to binary format
##   6.	Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart that  will calculate the roots of a quadratic
##       equation  Hint: d = sqrt ( ), and the roots are: x1 = (–b + d)/2a and x2 = (–b – d)/ 2a)
##   7.	Write an algorithm that reads three numbers and prints the value of the largest
##       number.
##   8.	The program is to input an examination mark and test it for the award of a
##      grade. The mark is a whole number between 1 and 100. Grades are awarded according to  the following criteria:
##       	>= 80 Distinction
##     	  >= 60 Merit
##     	  >= 40 Pass
##       	< 40 fail
##   9.	Write a program to calculate the sum and average of a series of numbers.
##   10.	 Write an algorithm to read 100 numbers then display the largest.
